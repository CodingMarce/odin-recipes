    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Sweetbread cooked in a seaweed salt crust with very exotic ingredients.</p>
        <p>Actually it seems disgusting.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 to 4 pairs sweetbreads</li>
            <li>4 peppercorns</li>
            <li>¼ cup coarsely chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon thyme</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>⅓ cup flour</li>
            <li>2 cups fine fresh bread crumbs</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put sweetbreads in a saucepan and add cold water to cover. Add 
                salt to taste, peppercorns, onion, bay leaf, thyme and parsley 
                sprigs. Bring to the boil and let simmer 10 minutes. Drain 
                thoroughly. Run under cold water to chill.</li>
            <li>Split the sweetbreads in half lengthwise. Put the halves on a 
                rack and cover with another rack. Place a weight on top and let 
                stand until ready to cook, 15 minutes or longer.</li>
            <li>Put the egg in a flat dish and add the water, salt, pepper and 
                one tablespoon of oil. Beat to blend.</li>
            <li>Put the flour and bread crumbs in separate flat dishes.</li>
            <li>Dip the sweetbread pieces first in flour, then in egg, then in 
                bread crumbs. The sweetbreads should be thoroughly coated, but 
                shake off excess. Pat the pieces all over to make the crumbs adhere.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in a skillet large enough to hold the 
                pieces in one layer. Cook on one side until golden. Turn and 
                cook until golden on the other side. Cook, turning occasionally, 
                about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ol>
