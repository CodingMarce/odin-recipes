        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Spread tomato paste onto the bottom of a 10-inch square 
                    baking dish. Sprinkle with onion and garlic. Stir in water 
                    and 1 tablespoon olive oil until thoroughly combined. Season 
                    with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Arrange alternating slices of eggplant, zucchini, yellow 
                    squash, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper, starting at 
                    the outer edge of the dish and working concentrically towards 
                    the center. Overlap slices a little to display colors.</li>
                <li>Drizzle vegetables with remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil; 
                    season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with thyme leaves. 
                    Cover vegetables with a piece of parchment paper cut to fit 
                    inside.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are roasted and 
                    tender, about 45 minutes. Serve with dollops of mascarpone cheese.</li>
